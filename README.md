# NXU-Business-Analytics-Project-Ready-Dataset
# Taco-Tel's Shield360 Project on Subscriber Churn Analysis

This project explores customer churn in a telecommunications company using a comprehensive dataset with demographic, service usage, and customer behavior information. The objective is to analyze patterns, engineer features, and prepare a clean, integrated dataset ready for predictive modeling.

### Project Overview

Customer churn is a major concern for telecom companies due to the high cost of customer acquisition. This project uses real-world simulated data to understand the factors contributing to churn and to prepare the data for future predictive modeling.

We perform the following tasks:
- Data merging from multiple sources
- Cleaning and preprocessing
- Feature engineering
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Data quality and bias assessment

### Dataset Description

The project uses **six CSV files** containing customer and service information:

- Telco_customer_churn.csv
- Telco_customer_churn_demographics.csv
- Telco_customer_churn_location.csv
- Telco_customer_churn_population.csv
- Telco_customer_churn_services.csv
- Telco_customer_churn_status.csv

Each file contains unique and overlapping attributes, joined by `Customer ID` and `Zip Code`.

### Cleaned Dataset Output

The final dataset was saved with the name 'telco_churn_cleaned.csv'.
